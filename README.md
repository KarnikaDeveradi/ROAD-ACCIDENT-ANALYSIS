## 📈 Visual Highlights & Dashboard Sections

### 🔹 Casualties by Vehicle Type

Displays the number of casualties caused by different vehicle types, including:

- 🚗 **Cars** – 155,804
- 🏍 **Bikes** – 15,610
- 🚐 **Vans** – 15,905
- 🚌 **Buses** – 6,573
- 🚜 **Agricultural Vehicles** – 399
- 🚫 **Others/Unclassified** – 1,446

This visualization helps identify which vehicle categories contribute most to road incidents.

---

### 🔹 Monthly Trend: Current Year (CY) vs Previous Year (PY)

A dual-line graph tracking casualties month-by-month, comparing two years side by side to identify:

- Seasonal peaks (e.g., holiday seasons)
- Drop in accidents due to lockdowns or policy changes
- Any unusual spikes or dips in reporting trends

---

### 🔹 Casualties by Urban vs Rural Areas

A donut chart clearly visualizing:

- **Urban Areas** – 61.95%
- **Rural Areas** – 38.05%

Urban areas dominate in accident numbers, providing a strong case for metro-area interventions.

---

### 🔹 Casualties by Road Type

Bar chart breakdown by road infrastructure:

- 🛣 **Single Carriageway** – 145K
- 🛣 **Dual Carriageway** – 32K
- 🔁 **Roundabouts** – 13K
- 🔄 **One-Way Streets** – 3K
- ↩ **Slip Roads** – 3K

Useful for traffic management departments to identify structural problem areas.

---

### 🔹 Casualties by Light Conditions

Analyzes when accidents happen based on light:

- ☀️ **Daylight** – 73.84%
- 🌑 **Darkness** – 26.16%

Indicates that visibility might not be the only factor in accident occurrence, prompting deeper investigation into driving behaviors or traffic congestion.

---

### 🗺️ Geographic Distribution of Accidents

An interactive Bing Map plot of accident locations across the UK:
- Cities like **London**, **Manchester**, **Glasgow**, **Birmingham**, and **Edinburgh**
- Dense clusters help identify accident hotspots
- Zoom and scroll functionality for deep dives into specific regions
